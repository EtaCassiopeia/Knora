# Knora

Knora (Knowledge Organization, Representation, and Annotation) is a software
framework for storing, sharing, and working with humanities data.

## Features

* Stores humanities data as [http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/](RDF) graphs.
* Includes OWL_ ontologies that express abstract, cross-disciplinary commonalities in the structure and semantics of research data.
* Can query, annotate, and link together heterogeneous data in a unified way.
* Offers a generic HTTP-based API for accessing and updating data.
* Uses a high-performance media server, called Sipi (to be released soon).
* Provides a general-purpose, browser-based Virtual Research Environment, called SALSAH (to be released soon).

## Status

### More or less complete

* The OWL ontologies
* API operations for querying and updating data
* The unit testing framework, which includes many tests

### Very incomplete

* API operations dealing with binary files and Sipi
* Integration of the SALSAH GUI
* Documentation
