# SALSAH APP v2 â€“ Based on AngularJS #

We're using [AngularJS 2](http://angular.io) for the framework and [Angular Material Design](http://material.angular.io) for the styling.

In the backend stands our own data management tool called [KNORA](http://knora.org)

SALSAH has two main apps:

* The **LandingPage** for the welcome site with the most important information about SALSAH and
* the **WorkSpace** similar to the current [salsah](http://salsah.org)-page.
